      <p>
        For a while, I was a React Denier. Yes, I know...but it's true. I was a
        full blown Vuenerd. I still love Vue, but my work situation required me
        to learn React. I begrudgingly obliged, and fairly quickly found myself
        watching a talk by Dan Abramov on React Hooks. I could certainly inject
        some terrible joke about being "hooked", but I'll spare you. That being
        said, that video was the beginning of my migration to React, and all of
        the new features that it provides us. This page is dedicated to all of
        the new fanciness that React dev's have in their toolbox; whether they
        know it or not. So sit back, and explore some of the cool features that
        React has to offer!
